                I've worked with HTML for about a year now, and I know all of the basic stuff there is to know.
                The language is kinda limited for its time period, but still very useful for websites

                The very looks of the pages you're viewing! I know a bit of CSS, worked with it a fair amount, 
                but the CSS library is enormous, and the things you can do with it is even bigger

                I've used JavaScript for around a year now, and I know my ins and outs of the language. 
                Of course, as most things, theres always more to learn, but I'm getting there!

            skills from a database, since it'd make it more "template based" and generally just make the code cleaner
